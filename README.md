# PAMGuard_resources
A set of comprehensive open sources tutorials for PAMGuard, including test data and settings files. 

## Current Tutorials
### Deep Learning
The deep learning tutorial demonstrates the use PAMGuard's [deep learning module](https://github.com/macster110/PAMGuard_DeepLearningSegmenter). The tutorial brings users through two examples, detecting right whales and classfying Danish bat species, demonstrtaing both PAMGuard real time and post processing capabilities along with the various display options for exploring results. The deep learning models are provided.

### Click train detection (Coming soon)
Echolocation clicks can be difficult to accurately classify, especially if they are broadband transients typically produced by most delphinid species. The click train detector module in PAMGuard tracks sequences of clicks which exhibit slowly varying properties, e.g, inter click interval, amplitude, correlation etc, and can be used with both multi and single channel data. The click train tutorial demosntrates three use cases, towed hydrophone arrays, SoundTraps and an alternative open source click train detection algorithm for CPODs.
